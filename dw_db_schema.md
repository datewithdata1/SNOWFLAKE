The provided code snippets are SQL statements for creating a Snowflake data warehouse, a database, and a schema. 

1. **Create Warehouse:**
   ```sql
   CREATE WAREHOUSE my_warehouse
   WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-SMALL'
   AUTO_SUSPEND = 600
   AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;
   ```
   - Creates a Snowflake data warehouse named `my_warehouse`.
   - Specifies the warehouse size as 'X-SMALL'.
   - Sets an automatic suspension time of 600 seconds (10 minutes) for the warehouse when idle.
   - Enables auto-resume for the warehouse.

2. **Create Database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE my_db;
   ```
   - Creates a database named `my_db`.

3. **Create Schema:**
   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA my_schema;
   ```
   - Creates a schema named `my_schema` within the default database.

These statements are written in SQL and are used for defining the data warehouse, database, and schema in a Snowflake environment.
