To perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Python with Snowflake, you can use the Snowflake Connector for Python. This connector allows you to interact with Snowflake databases using Python scripts. Before you start, make sure you have installed the Snowflake Connector for Python. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install snowflake-connector-python
```

Here's a simple example demonstrating CRUD operations:

```python
import snowflake.connector

# Replace these variables with your Snowflake credentials
snowflake_account = 'your_account_url'
snowflake_user = 'your_username'
snowflake_password = 'your_password'
snowflake_database = 'your_database'
snowflake_schema = 'your_schema'

# Establish a connection
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user=snowflake_user,
    password=snowflake_password,
    account=snowflake_account,
    database=snowflake_database,
    schema=snowflake_schema
)

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# CREATE operation
create_table_query = '''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS example_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING
)
'''
cursor.execute(create_table_query)

# INSERT operation
insert_data_query = '''
INSERT INTO example_table (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe')
'''
cursor.execute(insert_data_query)

# READ operation
select_query = '''
SELECT * FROM example_table
'''
cursor.execute(select_query)
result = cursor.fetchall()
print("Read operation result:")
for row in result:
    print(row)

# UPDATE operation
update_query = '''
UPDATE example_table SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1
'''
cursor.execute(update_query)

# READ operation after update
cursor.execute(select_query)
result = cursor.fetchall()
print("\nRead operation result after update:")
for row in result:
    print(row)

# DELETE operation
delete_query = '''
DELETE FROM example_table WHERE id = 1
'''
cursor.execute(delete_query)

# READ operation after delete
cursor.execute(select_query)
result = cursor.fetchall()
print("\nRead operation result after delete:")
for row in result:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

Remember to replace the placeholder values for `snowflake_account`, `snowflake_user`, `snowflake_password`, `snowflake_database`, and `snowflake_schema` with your actual Snowflake credentials.

This example demonstrates the basic CRUD operations using the Snowflake Connector for Python. Adjust the table structure and queries based on your specific use case.
